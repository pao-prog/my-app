However, around 1984 there was a significant drop in interest and graduation rates\n              of women in Computer Science. How can we explain this demographic shift?\n              <br/>\n              <br/>\n              During my research, I have found that the answer points back to the popularization of the personal computer \n              and how it was mainly marketed towards boys. In contrast, parents were encouraged \n              to purchase dolls and easy bake ovens for their daughters. We will ponder, in this curator\n              project, how sexist social ideology uses free-market\n              capitalism to keep women from accessing top-earning positions all the while forcing them to perform\n              unpaid labor such as within the domestic unit.\n              </div>\n          </div>\n\n          <div className=\"source-holder\">\n              <div className=\"hamilton_image\">\n                    <div className=\"hamilton_image-plus-caption\">\n                        <img className=\"hamilton_source\" src={require(`${hamilton}`).default} alt=\"display here\"></img>\n                        <div className=\"caption\">Margaret Hamilton 1969</div>\n                    </div>\n              </div>\n          </div>\n\n          <div className=\"source-holder\">\n              <div className=\"intro\">\n              The image to the left is a photograph from 1969 of Margaret Hamilton. \n              She and her team were in charge of writing all of the assembly code for the Apollo 11 mission. \n              The photograph shows her standing with the software created for the iconic space expedition.\n              The original source <a href=\"https://github.com/chrislgarry/Apollo-11\">code</a> can be found on Github.\n              <br/>\n              <br/>\n              Women such as Hamilton pioneered the software industry as we know it.\n              From performing the calculations themselves to manually writing command sheets and\n              making it possible for humans to program with keyboards and a screen, women made computer programming\n              into the high-status career it is today. For example, Grace Hopper is recognized for creating the first compiler\n              in 1952 and Mary Allen Wilkes was one of the first human beings to\n              have a computer in her home, as she had been tasked with writing software to make it programmable with a keyboard.\n              </div>\n          </div>\n\n          <div className=\"source-holder\">\n            <div className=\"easy_bake_ad\">\n                <video controls width=\"500\">\n                  <source src={require(`${easy_bake_video}`).default} type=\"video/mp4\"/>\n                  Sorry, your browser doesn't support embedded videos.\n                </video>\n                <div className=\"caption\">Easy Bake Oven Advertisement 1981</div>\n            </div>\n          </div>\n\n          <div className=\"source-holder\">\n              <div className=\"intro\">\n                To the left is a commercial for an easy bake oven from 1981.

The uptick in the use of software and its \n              growing central role in the American economy made it an attractive profession\n              for men. There are \n              <a href=\"https://www.aauw.org/resources/research/the-stem-gap/\"> studies </a> and \n              <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2018/02/the-more-gender-equality-the-fewer-women-in-stem/553592/\"> articles </a> that illustrate how labor\n              is gendered. This is in fact detrimental to a productive economy seeing as there is\n              a labor shortage.
