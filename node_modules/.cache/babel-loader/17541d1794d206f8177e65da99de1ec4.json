className=\"intro\">\n              Between the 1960s and 1990, the share of women making up the computer technology industry steadily rose\n              from 27% to <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/13/magazine/women-coding-computer-programming.html\">35%</a>.\n              The task of programming and performing calculations was usually assigned \n              to women – litteraly called computers – because it was not high-status work at the time.\n              Men focused on hardware instead. However, around 1984 there was a significant drop in interest and graduation rates\n              of women in Computer Science. How can we explain this demographic shift?\n              <br/>\n              <br/>\n              During my research, I have found that the answer points back to the popularization of the personal computer \n              and how it was mainly marketed towards boys. In contrast, parents were encouraged \n              to purchase dolls and easy bake ovens for their daughters. We will ponder, in this curator\n              project, how sexist social ideology uses free-market\n              capitalism to keep women from accessing top-earning positions all the while forcing them to perform\n              unpaid labor such as within the domestic unit.\n              </div>\n          </div>\n\n          <div className=\"source-holder\">\n              <div className=\"hamilton_image\">\n                    <div className=\"hamilton_image-plus-caption\">\n                        <img className=\"hamilton_source\" src={require(`${hamilton}`).default} alt=\"display here\"></img>\n                        <div className=\"caption\">Margaret Hamilton 1969</div>\n                    </div>\n              </div>\n          </div>\n\n          <div className=\"source-holder\">\n              <div className=\"intro\">\n              The image to the left is a photograph from 1969 of Margaret Hamilton. \n              She and her team were in charge of writing all of the assembly code for the Apollo 11 mission. \n              The photograph shows her standing with the software created for the iconic space expedition.\n              </div>\n          </div>\n\n          <div className=\"source-holder\">\n              <div className=\"univac_image\">\n                    <div className=\"image-plus-caption\">\n                        <img className=\"source\" src={require(`${univac}`).default} alt=\"display here\"></img>\n                        <div className=\"caption\">Univac Computer in the 1950s.</div>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n          </div>\n\n          <div className=\"source-holder\">\n              <div className=\"intro\">\n                  Pioneers of the software world, women are the reason we have computing as we know it.
