environment. \n              At the height of the Space Race, employed by organizations such as NASA, \n              they were quite literally called “computers”, being in charge of calculations \n              and programming the massive machines. So, what happened? Why is the computer science \n              and information technology space dominated by men right now? During my research, \n              I’ve found that the answer points back to the popularization of the personal computer \n              and how it was mainly marketed to little boys. In contrast, parents were encouraged \n              to buy their daughters dolls and easy bake ovens. As you can see in this \n              commodore advertisement from 1985, the main user of the PC is an all-American little boy.\n              </div>\n          </div>\n\n          <div className=\"source-holder\">\n              <div className=\"hamilton_image\">\n                    <div className=\"hamilton_image-plus-caption\">\n                        <img className=\"hamilton_source\" src={require(`${hamilton}`).default} alt=\"display here\"></img>\n                        <div className=\"caption\">Margaret Hamilton 1969</div>\n                    </div>\n              </div>\n          </div>\n\n          <div className=\"source-holder\">\n              <div className=\"intro\">\n              The image to the left is a photograph from 1969.
